- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Input validation with express-validator
- Rate limiting (5 login attempts per 15 minutes)
- MySQL database with 27 tables
- Transaction support for registration
- CORS configured for frontend
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Morgan for request logging
- Job reporting with Redis rate limiting (5 reports per user per 24h)
- Admin analytics API endpoints (overview, timeline, popular, retention, KPI)
- Typo tolerance and autocomplete suggestions – SOUNDEX‑based term matching and prefix suggestions from `search_logs`.

#### Cover Letters
- **Table:** `cover_letters` (user_id, name, content, is_default, timestamps)
- **CRUD Endpoints** (JWT‑protected):
  - `GET /api/cover-letters` – Get all cover letters for the authenticated user.
  - `POST /api/cover-letters` – Create a new cover letter (name and content required).
  - `PUT /api/cover-letters/:id` – Update name and/or content (owner only).
  - `DELETE /api/cover-letters/:id` – Delete a cover letter (owner only).
  - `PUT /api/cover-letters/:id/default` – Set a cover letter as default (unsets others for the same user).
- **Business Rules:**
  - The first cover letter created is automatically set as default.
  - If the default cover letter is deleted, the most recently updated one becomes the new default.
  - The default cover letter is automatically selected when a job seeker applies to a job (frontend integration pending).

#### FULLTEXT Search
- **Index:** `ft_search` on `jobs(title, description, requirements)` for fast, relevant searching.
- **Search parameter:** `?search=React` – uses `MATCH() AGAINST()` in natural language mode.
- **Relevance scoring:** `relevance_score` column available in results when `search` is provided.
- **Sort by relevance:** `?sort=relevance` – orders results by relevance score descending.
- **Backward compatibility:** Legacy `keyword` parameter still works via `LIKE` queries.
- **Seamless integration:** Works with all existing filters (location, job type, salary range) and pagination.

#### Resume Parsing & CRUD
- **Parsing Libraries:** `pdf-parse-fork` (PDF) and `mammoth` (DOCX) extract structured text from uploaded resumes.
- **Extracted Fields:** Full name, email, phone number, skills list, work experience (title, company, dates, description), education (degree, institution, year).
- **Database Storage:** Parsed data is stored as a JSON object in the `parsed_data` column of the `resumes` table.
- **Full CRUD Endpoints** (all protected with JWT):
  - `POST /api/users/resume` – Upload, parse, and save a resume (automatically sets as primary).
  - `GET /api/users/resume` – Retrieve all resumes for the authenticated user.
  - `GET /api/users/resume/primary` – Get the primary resume’s parsed data (for auto-filling the profile).
  - `GET /api/users/resume/:id` – Get a single resume by ID.
  - `PUT /api/users/resume/:id` – Update resume metadata (`title`, `is_primary`).
  - `DELETE /api/users/resume/:id` – Delete a resume (and its file) – if primary, promotes the most recent resume.
  - `PUT /api/users/resume/:id/primary` – Set a specific resume as primary (unsets others).
- **File Storage:** Uploaded resumes are stored in `uploads/resumes/` with unique filenames.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure with user‑friendly error messages; malformed files are rejected.

#### Admin Reports Queue UI
- **Frontend:** Located entirely inside `AdminDashboard.jsx` (Reports tab, table, filters, action buttons, and confirmation modal) – no separate `ReportsTable.jsx` component needed.
- **Backend:** `PUT /api/admin/reports/:id/status` – Admin‑only endpoint to resolve job reports.
- **Workflow:**
  - Admin Dashboard → “Reports” section with a dedicated table.
  - Table filters: **Status** (Pending, Approved, Removed, Dismissed), **Reason** (Spam, Fraud, Inappropriate, Duplicate, Other), and **Date range**.
  - Each row displays: Job Title, Reporter, Reason, Status, and Action buttons.
  - Action buttons: **Approve** (keep job), **Remove** (soft‑delete job), **Dismiss** (no action), **Ban Employer** (bans the employer + removes all their active jobs).
  - **Confirmation Modal:** Opens when an action is clicked, includes an optional `resolution_notes` text field.
  - Upon confirmation, report status is updated in DB and job `is_active` toggled if necessary.
- **Email Notification:** After resolution, a background email is queued via Bull + Redis to notify the reporter using the `report-resolution.html` template.
- **Audit Logging:** All resolution actions are logged in the `audit_logs` table for compliance.
- **Rate Limiting:** 5 reports per user per 24 hours (Redis).
- **Duplicate Check:** One report per user per job.

#### Search Term Logging & Keyword Highlighting
- **Table:** `search_logs` stores every search with the term, user ID, IP address, result count, and timestamp.
- **Logging:** Every search request is logged automatically in the background. Guest searches are logged with IP address only.
- **Analytics:** Admins can view search trends via SQL queries or future analytics dashboards.
- **Frontend Highlighting:** Matching terms in job titles and descriptions are wrapped with `<mark class="bg-yellow-200">` to visually show why a job was matched.
- **Implementation:**
  - Middleware: `searchLogger.js` automatically logs each search before passing to the controller.
  - Controller: `jobController.js` updates the `result_count` in the log after the query runs.
  - Frontend: `highlightText.js` utility function is used in `JobCard.jsx` to wrap matches.

### Saved Searches Feature
- Job seekers can create, read, update, and delete saved search criteria.
- Table `saved_searches` stores search name, keyword, location, job type, salary range, alert frequency, and active status.
- Secured API endpoints (JWT‑protected) – users can only manage their own saved searches.
- Integrated with the job alert system: when a new job is posted, matching saved searches trigger email notifications to the respective job seekers.

### Background Email Queue
All transactional emails are now queued and processed asynchronously using Bull and Redis.  
Email sending no longer blocks API responses – the server just enqueues a job and returns immediately.

| Component    | Technology / File        | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queue        | Bull + Redis             | Holds email jobs and processes them in the background          |
| Worker       | `workers/emailWorker.js` | Standalone Node.js process that picks up jobs and sends emails |
| Job logging  | `email_logs` table       | Stores job lifecycle (queued, processing, sent, failed)        |
| Queue helper | `addEmailJob(data)`      | Enqueues a job and inserts an initial log entry                |

**Key benefits:**
- API endpoints return instantly – email delivery does not delay the response.
- All email sending is retryable and logged.
- Worker runs independently from the Express server (no shared memory).

### Email Rate Limiting & Retry Logic
To avoid spam and improve reliability, the email queue has built‑in rate limiting and automatic retries.

- **Rate limiting (per user):**  
  Tracks the number of emails triggered by a user within a 60‑second window using Redis.  
  If a user exceeds 10 emails in that window, the request is rejected with a **429 Too Many Requests** response and the message *“Too many emails. Limit is 10 per minute.”*  
  The limit resets automatically after 60 seconds.

- **Retry & dead‑letter handling:**  
  When an email delivery fails, Bull automatically retries the job up to **3 times** with a custom backoff:
  - 1st retry after **1 minute**
  - 2nd retry after **5 minutes**
  - 3rd retry after **15 minutes**  
  If all attempts fail, the job is marked as permanently **failed**, and an alert email is sent to the administrator.

- **Logging:**  
  Every attempt is recorded in the `email_logs` table (`user_id`, `status`, `attempts`, `error_message`), so the full lifecycle of each email can be audited.

### Email Service Features
- **Welcome email** sent automatically after user registration.
- **Application status update email** sent to job seekers when an employer changes the status of their application.
- Configurable via environment variables (SMTP host, port, user, password).
- Graceful error handling – email failures do not break the flow of registration or status updates.
- Test script to verify SMTP configuration (`server/scripts/test-email.js`).
- Uses **Resend** (or any SMTP provider) – high deliverability and free tier (3,000 emails/month).

#### Email Templates
Five responsive HTML email templates are used for different notifications. All templates are stored in `server/src/email-templates/`. Each template uses inline CSS for email client compatibility, includes a plain‑text fallback, and contains a clear call‑to‑action button.

| Template File                   | Purpose                                                       | Key Placeholders                                                                                                                                                                                 | CTA Button           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `application-confirmation.html` | Sent to job seeker after applying                             | `{{user_name}}`, `{{job_title}}`, `{{company_name}}`, `{{job_location}}`, `{{job_type}}`, `{{salary_range}}`, `{{dashboard_url}}`                                                                | View My Applications |
| `status-change.html`            | Sent to job seeker when application status changes            | `{{user_name}}`, `{{job_title}}`, `{{company_name}}`, `{{new_status}}`, `{{status_color}}`, `{{status_message}}`, `{{dashboard_url}}`                                                            | View Details         |
| `new-job-alert.html`            | Sent to job seekers when a new job matches their saved search | `{{user_name}}`, `{{saved_search_name}}`, `{{job_title}}`, `{{company_name}}`, `{{job_location}}`, `{{job_type}}`, `{{salary_range}}`, `{{job_summary}}`, `{{job_url}}`, `{{manage_alerts_url}}` | View & Apply         |
| `new-applicant.html`            | Sent to employer when a job seeker applies                    | `{{company_name}}`, `{{job_title}}`, `{{applicant_name}}`, `{{applicant_email}}`, `{{applied_date}}`, `{{cover_letter_preview}}`, `{{applicants_url}}`                                           | Review Applicant     |
| `account-verification.html`     | Sent to new users for email confirmation (future feature)     | `{{user_name}}`, `{{verification_url}}`                                                                                                                                                          | Verify Email Address |


**Email Integration Flow:**

| Trigger                                | Template Called                                | Recipient            |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| User registers                         | `account-verification.html` (or welcome email) | New user             |
| Job seeker applies to a job            | `application-confirmation.html`                | Job seeker           |
| Job seeker applies to a job            | `new-applicant.html`                           | Employer             |
| Employer updates application status    | `status-change.html`                           | Job seeker           |
| New job posted (matching saved search) | `new-job-alert.html`                           | Matching job seekers |
| Admin resolves a job report            | ``report-resolution.html``                     | Reporter             |

All emails are sent asynchronously; failures are logged but do not break the main functionality.

### Google OAuth Setup (Backend)

#### Overview:
- Enables social login with Google using Passport.js

#### Endpoints (`server/src/routes/authRoutes.js`):
| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /api/auth/google          | Redirects to Google login page                            |
| GET    | /api/auth/google/callback | Handles callback and redirects to frontend with JWT token |

- Because `passport.authenticate` handles the redirect, no controller logic is required for these routes.

#### Environment Variables:
- Add the following to `server/.env`:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here

#### Dependencies:
- `passport`
- `passport-google-oauth20`

#### Google Cloud Console Setup:

- Go to `Google Cloud Console` and create a new project.
- Navigate to `APIs & Services → Credentials`.
- Click Create `Credentials → OAuth client ID` (Web application).
- Set Authorized JavaScript origins: `http://localhost:5173`
- Set Authorized redirect URIs: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback`
- Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into `.env`.

#### Passport Strategy (`server/src/config/passport.js`):

- Uses `GoogleStrategy` with `clientID` and `clientSecret`.
- Callback URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback`.
- Fetches user's `google_id`, email, and name.
- If user exists by `google_id` → generates JWT.
- If user exists by email → links `google_id` to existing account.
- If new user → creates account (role: `job_seeker`), then generates JWT.

### LinkedIn OAuth Setup - Backend (Disabled)

#### Overview:
- LinkedIn OAuth is not yet enabled due to LinkedIn’s requirement for a `Company Page` and `10+ connections` on the developer’s account. The routes are currently disabled and return a `503` status.

#### Future Activation:
- When LinkedIn credentials are added to `server/.env` and the Passport strategy is uncommented, the feature can be activated.

LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_linkedin_client_id_here
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_linkedin_client_secret_here

### Daily Job Alert Cron Job

**Features:**
- Node‑cron job scheduled every day at 8 AM.
- Scans all active saved searches with alert_frequency = 'daily'.
- Queries jobs created since the last run that match each search's criteria (keyword, location, job type, salary range).
- Builds a digest email with up to 20 matching jobs and sends it via the background email queue.
- Each email includes an unsubscribe link (unique token per saved search) that deactivates the search permanently.
- Stores the *ast‑run timestamp in the cron_state table to avoid duplicate alerts.

### Notify Reporter on Resolution

**Feature:**  
- When an admin resolves a job report (status changes to `approved`, `removed`, or `dismissed`), the reporter receives an automated email notification with the resolution outcome.

**How it works:**
- **Table:** `job_reports` (resolution fields: `resolved_at`, `resolved_by`, `resolution_notes`)
- **API Endpoint:** `PUT /api/admin/reports/:id/status` (admin‑only, JWT protected)
- **Status options:** `approved` (no action taken), `removed` (job soft‑deleted), `dismissed` (no violation found)
- **Side effect:** When `removed` is chosen, the job’s `is_active` flag is set to `0` (soft‑delete)
- **Email:** Queued via Bull + Redis using the `report-resolution.html` template, containing:
  - Reporter name
  - Job title
  - Reason for the report
  - Resolution label (e.g., "Job Removed")
  - Admin note (optional)
  - Dashboard link

**Email Template (`report-resolution.html`):**  
Five‑section responsive email with a clear resolution badge and a "Go to Dashboard" call‑to‑action. The email is queued asynchronously, respecting the user’s email rate limit (10 per minute). All resolution actions are logged in the `audit_logs` table.

**Admin UI Integration:**  
The `ReportsTable` component (used in Admin Dashboard) displays pending reports and provides **Resolve** buttons (Approve, Remove, Dismiss). When an admin takes action, the reporter is notified immediately via the background email queue.

**Benefits:**
- Transparency – reporters know that their report was reviewed and what action was taken.
- Reduces unnecessary follow‑up questions.
- Builds trust in the moderation system.

### Resume Upload 

**Features:**
- Drag‑and‑drop zone and click‑to‑browse file input (`.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, max 5 MB).
- Client‑side validation: file type and size with toast error messages.
- Real‑time upload progress bar (simulated until backend integration).
- **Backend integration:** Sends file to `POST /api/users/resume` using `multipart/form-data`.
- On success, the backend parses the resume and stores the JSON in the `parsed_data` column of the `resumes` table.
- The primary resume’s parsed data can be retrieved via `GET /api/users/resume/primary` to auto‑fill the profile form.
- Delete Resume button removes the file from storage and clears the database record.
- Dynamic Profile Strength update when a resume is uploaded or deleted.
- Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space on dropzone triggers file picker).
- Responsive design with media queries.

### Navbar

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally in under 15 minutes:

### Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/Mayaman-prog/Smart_Hire.git
- cd Smart_Hire

### Client Setup
- cd client
- npm install
- npm run dev

#### Client will run on: `http://localhost:5173`

## Server Setup

### Open a new terminal:
- cd server
- npm install
- npm run dev

#### Server will run on: `http://localhost:5000`

## Database Setup (MySQL)
- Start MySQL (via XAMPP Control Panel)
- Create database:
`CREATE DATABASE smart_hire;`
`USE smart_hire;`

- Run Database Setup Script
`cd server`
`npm run setup-db`
- This creates all tables and inserts seed data.

## Email Service Setup

SmartHire uses **Nodemailer** with **Resend** (or any SMTP provider) to send transactional emails:

- **Welcome emails** on user registration.
- **Application status update emails** to job seekers.
- **Report resolution emails** to reporters.

### Configure email credentials

Add the following variables to your `server/.env` file:

**.env**
#### Email configuration (Resend example)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=resend
SMTP_PASS=re_YourApiKeyHere
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com   # for test script

- You can use any SMTP provider (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, Brevo). For development, Ethereal (fake SMTP) or Resend is recommended.

### Test Email Service

After configuring .env, run:
- cd server
- node scripts/test-email.js

- If successful, you will see (Test email sent successfully.) and the email will be delivered (or captured in Ethereal/Mailtrap).

- Email sending is integrated into the registration and application status update flows. Failure to send an email does not break the main operation – errors are logged only.

## Email Templates

Five responsive HTML email templates are used for different notifications. ALl templates are stored in `server/src/email-templates/`.

| Template                        | Trigger                              | Recipient  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `application-confirmation.html` | Job seeker applies to job            | Job seeker |
| `status-change.html`            | Employer updates application status  | Job seeker |
| `new-job-alert.html`            | New job posted matching saved search | Job seeker |
| `new-applicant.html`            | Job seeker applies to job            | Employer   |
| `account-verification.html`     | User registers (future)              | New user   |
| `report-resolution.html`        | Admin resolves a job report          | Reporter   |

Each template uses inline CSS, is responsive, includes a plain‑text fallback, and contains a clear call‑to‑action button.

**Backend and API Integration**

- JWT Authentication (register, login, profile) with bcrypt and rate limiting
- Job CRUD APIs (`/api/jobs`) with filtering, sorting, pagination
- Application APIs (`/api/applications`) – submit, status update, withdraw
- Saved Jobs APIs (`/api/saved-jobs`) – save, fetch, remove
- Company APIs (`/api/companies`) – fetch all, fetch by ID
- Admin APIs (`/api/admin`) – users, jobs, companies, toggle user status
- Admin Dashboard analytics APIs (`/admin/analytics/kpi`, `/admin/analytics/timeline`, `/admin/analytics/popular`)
- Resume CRUD APIs (`/api/users/resume`) – upload/parse, fetch all, fetch primary, update metadata, delete, set as primary
